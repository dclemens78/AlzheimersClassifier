# Senior-Project
For this project we decieded to build an AI model with the task of early onset Alzheimer's disease detection.
Our AI model will take MRI images of brain scans and determine whether or not the patient is developing early onset
Alzheimer's.
Paired with the brain imaging we plan on making a machine that takes in touch and speech input.
The touch portion of the machine will test the motor skills of the patient testing them on various games.
For example, associates/matching games, and pattern and memory-based games. The speech portion of the
machine will use a natural language processing model which will detect if the patient is having difficulty
finding certain words or losing their flow of speech.
Based on the input given our AI model will determine whether or not our patient has early onset Alzhimer's disease.
